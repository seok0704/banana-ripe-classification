# Banana Ripe Level Classification Project

## Project Overview
In this project, we propose to develop a classification model that predicts the ripeness of the banana and aim to build a machine learning pipeline using Amazon SageMaker that can be deployed on a mobile app or web application that processes the real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of the banana, the algorithm will identify the banana's ripeness level. If the image supplied is not a banana, the model will also detect for this and output a message accordingly.
